# AI-Verbal-Communication-Skills-Trainer

# Objective

Develop a wrapper application around an open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, GROK from xAI if open-sourced, or any model from Hugging Face) to help learners improve their verbal communication skills. The application should support chat and voice interactions, provide skill-training activities, and assess presentations with feedback. Incorporate basic optimizations for efficiency and flexibility in deployment, using either ChatUI, Gradio, or an API-based approach for the interface.

# Features

Chat Feedback: Users can input text and receive AI-generated feedback on clarity, tone, and structure.

Voice Feedback: Speech-to-text processing using Whisper, followed by AI evaluation.

Skill Training: Interactive exercises to improve impromptu speaking, storytelling, and conflict resolution.

Progress Tracking: Stores user performance metrics in a SQLite database.

# Technologies Used

LLM Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (or similar open-source models)

Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper

Frontend: Gradio for user interaction

Database: SQLite for storing progress data

Libraries: Transformers, Torch, Librosa, Soundfile, NumPy

# Installation
